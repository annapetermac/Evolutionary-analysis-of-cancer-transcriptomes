# Evolutionary analysis of cancer transcriptomes
Trigos, A.S., Pearson, R.B., Papenfuss, A.T., Goode, D.L. 2017. Altered interactions between unicellular and multicellular genes drive hallmarks of transformation in a diverse range of solid tumors. PNAS 114 (24) 6406-6411.


Scripts to perform evolutionary analysis of cancer transcriptomes:
- TAI and activity levels of phylostrata calculations in tumours and normals
- Associate the level of activity of cellular processes with gene ages
- Analyse the connections between cellular processes based on their evolutionary history

Helper scripts to be loaded to main scripts are identified as "_functions".
