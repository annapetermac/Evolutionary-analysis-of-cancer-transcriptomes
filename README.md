# Evolutionary analysis of cancer transcriptomes

Scripts to perform evolutionary analysis of cancer transcriptomes:
- TAI and activity levels of phylostrata calculations in tumours and normals
- Associate the level of activity of cellular processes with gene ages
- Analyse the connections between cellular processes based on their evolutionary history

Helper scripts to be loaded to main scripts are identified as "_functions".
